# Linear Regression (From Scratch)

This module contains an **end-to-end implementation of Linear Regression from scratch** using Python, without relying on machine learning libraries such as `sklearn`.

The goal is to understand how linear regression works internally by building each component step by step.

## 📌 Overview

Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

In this implementation, the model is trained using **Gradient Descent** to minimize the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** cost function.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement Linear Regression without ML libraries
- Understand the role of the hypothesis function
- Implement and minimize a cost function using Gradient Descent
- Observe convergence behavior through loss curves
- Visualize the learned model against real data
