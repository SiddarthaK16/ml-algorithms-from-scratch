## 📌 Overview

This repository is a personal learning project aimed at building strong fundamentals in machine learning by implementing algorithms step by step using basic Python and numerical tools.

The emphasis is on:
- clarity over performance  
- understanding over abstraction  
- learning how things work under the hood

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement core machine learning algorithms from first principles
- Understand optimization techniques like Gradient Descent
- Visualize learning behavior through plots and loss curves
- Build intuition around convergence, scaling, and model behavior
- Maintain a clean, modular, and extensible codebase
